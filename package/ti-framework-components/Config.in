	  The Framework Components product enables faster implementation
	  of application frameworks that use algorithms and codecs that
	  comply to the XDAIS standard. XDAIS defines standards that prevent
	  algorithms from hard-coding ownership of system resources such
	  as memory and DMA channels. An XDAIS-compliant algorithm enables
	  the application framework to query it and provide information on
	  specific memory DMA and other resources it needs. This makes
	  integration of algorithms from multiple sources much easier.
